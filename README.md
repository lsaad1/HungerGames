I created a sumbmissions folder using command: "mkdir Submission" then I used the touch command: "touch README.md" 
I created a file in my submissions folder using nano HungerGames.txt I opened the enpty file and use ^R(read files) search back to the parent directory went into cumoja1 folder and sleceted the HungerGames.txt the text then transferred to my HungerGames.txt. 

Now i want to change all the "Katniss" name to my name "LAURA" so i used ^W to find where the name "Katniss" is then i selected ^R to replace All the name "Katniss" to "LAURA" 

**I also editied the 1 out by the authors name**
